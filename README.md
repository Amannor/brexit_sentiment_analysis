# brexit_sentiment_analysis
Playing with tweets regarding Brexit.

 - I took the [Harvard Dataverst Twitter dataset about brexit](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/KP4XRP) that's annotated with sentiments and stances towards the Brexit.
 - I later used Twitter's API to fetch additional fields of each tweet (posting date and text).
 - Finally, I did several attempts at showing temporal trends (using aggregations of the sentiments), These can be seen in the "plots" folder
