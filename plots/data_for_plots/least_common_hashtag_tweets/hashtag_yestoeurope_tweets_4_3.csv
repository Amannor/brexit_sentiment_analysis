All other options will mean a decade of negotiations &amp; real economic harm. The Brexiteer elite will not feel it - but we will.  #StopTheCoup #BollocksToBrexit #RemainAlliance #YestoEurope https://t.co/84zljPZKA0,['yestoeurope']

Any Brexit deal will harm people across the country - our current deal will not harm them.

There will be many years of acrimonious &amp; hard negotiations ahead. The only way to get Brexit done is to Remain!

These will have to be negotiated - remain ends the pain immediately. Je suis European #StopTheCoup #RemainAlliance #YestoEurope https://t.co/9hYzDHWJ2j",['yestoeurope']
