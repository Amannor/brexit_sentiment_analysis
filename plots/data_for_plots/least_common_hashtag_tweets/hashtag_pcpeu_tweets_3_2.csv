All you and the #PCPEU lot have done is help Corbyn sully the waters and help the Tories achieve their fucked-up Brexit!,['pcpeu']

It's no coincidence that moderates in @UKLabour are more likely to be Pro-Europeans.

Still not sure how the Pro Corbyn Pro EU #PCPEU group can stay on.

It's just so frustrating for someone like me who's been calling out Corbyn's Brexit credentials since 2016 only to be told time and time again by the #PCPEU lot that I was wrong.

Look how far they led us!",['pcpeu']

When will the #FBPE and #PCPEU mob realise that it’s easier to get rid of the Tories than ‘reform the EU?’
